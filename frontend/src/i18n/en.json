    "intro": "BolåneRadar is an independent web service for comparing and analyzing Swedish mortgage rates. The purpose of the service is to make it easier for consumers to understand market interest rates and gain better decision support when choosing a bank or renegotiating a mortgage.",

    "noAds": "Unlike many comparison services, BolåneRadar is free from advertising, sponsored placements, and commercial incentives. All information presented is based on publicly available data from the banks’ own sources and is displayed in a consistent and transparent manner.",

    "smartRate": "A central part of the service is the Smart Rate Test, which helps users evaluate their own mortgage rate in relation to the market. By combining user-provided information with current and historical market data, the service provides a clear assessment of how competitive an offer is — without requiring prior financial expertise.",

    "architecture": "BolåneRadar is developed with a strong focus on clear separation of responsibilities, robust technology, and long-term maintainability. All analysis and data processing are handled in the backend, while the frontend is designed to be fast, clear, and easy to understand.",

        "Average rates instead show the average interest rate that the bank’s customers have had during a given period and often provide a more realistic picture of the interest level.",
        "However, a low average rate does not automatically mean that the same terms are available to everyone. The interest rate is influenced by factors such as loan size, loan-to-value ratio, customer relationship, and negotiation position."

        "The charts in BolåneRadar show how average mortgage rates have changed over time and can help identify patterns, trends, and stability.",
        "At the same time, interest rates are affected by factors such as inflation, policy rates, and economic conditions, making future levels uncertain. Historical data should therefore be seen as a tool for understanding rather than prediction."
